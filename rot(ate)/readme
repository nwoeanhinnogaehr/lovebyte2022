Infos:
    You will want to turn up your subwoofer for this one! Yes, the visuals are
    not so interesting, but 128b is *really* tiny on Linux. At this size, you
    ultimately get to choose visuals or sounds. I chose to fork into two
    processes and run the exact same code for both visuals and sounds, just
    with a different file descriptor in ebx :)

Recommended environment:
    Any distro with aplay audio player working where you can set the
    framebuffer resolution to something small, like 512x256. The graphics are
    kind of slow, so if you run it at a high resolution, you will get low FPS.
    For instructions on getting the framebuffer set up, see here:

To run:
    $ ./rot(ate)
